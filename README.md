# srms
# Student Result Management System app
For the purpose of this test I created a disposable mongodb account with a disposable email, that is why I have mongodb url in the file exposed - after some time it will be destroyed. Otherwise I would use .env file/ use env variable on a hosting account.
# To run the app:
# clone the repo
# go to /client and run npm i - client runs on port: 3000
# go to /backend and run npm i - backend runs on port:5000
# in /client run npm start
# in /backend run nodemon server.js or npm start
